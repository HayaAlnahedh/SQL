--> I am quantifying statistics and filtering data about customer and order data from a database with multiple tables in it by using sqlitestudio. 

1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE LENGTH (orderID)=6 AND orderID <>'Order ID';


2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone' 
AND LENGTH (orderID)=6 AND orderID <>'Order ID';


3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id=FEB.orderID
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'


4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT DISTINCT Product, min(Price)
from BIT_DB.JanSales
group by Product, Price
order by price ASC LIMIT 1;


5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity)*price as Revenue
from BIT_DB.JanSales
Group by Product;


6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, 
sum(Quantity), 
SUM(Quantity)*price as Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERe location=  '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;


7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
Select 
count (distinct cust.acctnum), avg( Quantity*price) 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON cust.order_id = feb.orderID
WHERE feb.Quantity> 2
AND length(orderid)=6
and orderid <> 'Order ID';


8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold. 
SELECT Product, SUM(quantity) 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%' 
GROUP BY Product;
